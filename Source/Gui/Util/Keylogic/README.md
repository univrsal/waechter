This library contains the code for validating serial keys. Registration is entirely cosmetic and
does not change the functionality of the application.

It can safely be removed or ignored.

While it mostly defeats the purpose the code for validation is included for transparency.

For registering the application you have the following options:

- Remove/alter the registration code
- Have someone else remove/alter the registration code
- Use someone else's serial key
- Get a serial key by mailing [waechter@vrsal.xyz](mailto:waechter@vrsal.xyz) with the desired username and asking
  nicely for one
