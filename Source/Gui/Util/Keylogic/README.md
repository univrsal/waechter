This library contains the code for validating serial keys. Registration is entirely cosmetic and
does not change the functionality of the application.

It can safely be removed or ignored.

While it mostly defeats the purpose the code for validation is included for transparency.

See [waechter.st/register)[https://waechter.st/register] for more information.
