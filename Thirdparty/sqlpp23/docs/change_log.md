# Change log

## next

## 0.69

Fix compilation error in gcc-15 and higher, #111

## 0.68

Highlight:

Straight-forward support for mapping columns to custom stypes is huge
for type safety, see [docs](/docs/recipes/custom_types.md), #106

Breaking changes:

- Add log_category parameter to log function, #86
- verbatim_clause replaces verbatim if used as a clause in a custom query
- insert_into(t).columns() does not support dynamic columns any more.
  - Instead, add_values supports dynamic assignments which fall back to DEFAULT assignment if the dynamic condition is false.
- sqlpp23-ddl2cpp changes:
  - command-line option `--path-to-datatype-file` was renamed to `--path-to-custom-types`
  - renamed some base types in custom types file to match the corresponding sqlpp23 data types:
    - integer -> integral
    - date_time -> timestamp
- forbid order_by, limit, offset, and for_update in union arguments (while mysql and postgresql would allow order_by, limit, and offset if the arguments and enclosed in parentheses, these clauses are not allowed in sqlite3 and parentheses aren't allowed either), #83
  - add order_by, limit, and offset to union expressions, e.g. `lhs.union(rhs).order_by(t.id).limit(10).offset(10)`, #83
- forbid expressions that require tables in limit and offset, e.g. `limit(t.id)`

Other changes:

- add user-defined literal to allow to create a nametag provider from a string literal, e.g. used like this `foo.as("left"_alias);`, #107
- add .as<"my_name">() overload (requires C++26 with reflection), #99
- deprecate result_row_t::as_tuple
- new as_tuple(const result_row_t&)
- new get_sql_name_tuple(const result_row_t&), #72
- sqlpp23-ddl2cpp changes:
  - if an error is found in the custom types file, the program exits with error code 30
  - base types in the custom types file should use `snake_case`, although the old `CamelCase` is still supported for backwards compatibility
  - documented the format of the custom types file
  - recognize and process "ALTER TABLE...ALTER COLUMN...SET DEFAULT" commands, which improves processing of pg_dump output scripts.

## 0.67

Module support

- Basic support for modules, see [docs](/docs/modules.md), #30
- `core/name/create_name_tag.h` is now a stand-alone header, #30
- Revamped commandline switches for `sqlpp23-ddl2cpp`, see [docs](/docs/ddl2cpp.md)
- Instead of `cte(sqlpp::alias::a)`, you now have to call `sqlpp::cte(sqlpp::alias::a)`
- Support comparison member functions for comparison expressions, e.g. you can now order by comparison results, #39
- order_by allows duplicate expressions, #39
- Install modules into `<prefix>/modules/sqlpp23`, #58

## 0.66

First release of sqlpp23

It is tagged 0.66 as it is a continuation from sqlpp11-0.65.

Major differences for library users are documented in
docs/differences_to_sqlpp11.md

Beyond that, the switch to C++23 makes the library easier to maintain,
easier to extend, and (I think) easier to read. One of the nicest
features of C++23 in this regard is "Deducing this" (P0847R7) as it
makes CRTP significantly simpler to write and reason about.

See for instance

- statement_t: include/sqlpp23/core/query/statement.h
- all clauses: include/sqlpp23/core/clause/*.h
