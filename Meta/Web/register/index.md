title: Registering
---

If you install an official build of Wächter it'll show as unregistered in the
title bar and in the bottom right corner. This has no effect on the functionality
of the application and is also trivial to remove or bypass, if you want to have
a crack at it [this is the relevant code](https://github.com/univrsal/waechter/tree/master/Source/Gui/Util/Keylogic),
don't look at the commit history, though. I accidentally committed the code to
generate serial keys at one point.

To register the application you have a couple of options:

- remove the registration code and compile from source,
- have someone else remove the registration code,
- use someone else's serial key or an unofficial one or
- get an official serial key.

If the thought of pirating software would keep you up at night you can get an 
authentic key by

- emailing register |at| waechter.st with the desired user name (max. 14 characters),
- asking nicely and
- (optionally) giving me [fake Internet money](https://vrsal.cc/donate).

If you end up donating and include the transaction id in your email you'll get
the source code to the free as in freedom keygen for Wächter shown at the end
of the [intro video](/docs/index.md) so you can generate as many
keys as you want.
